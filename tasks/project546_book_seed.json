The left hemisphere is detail oriented, prefers mechanisms to living things & is inclined to self-interest. The right hemisphere has greater breadth, flexibility & generosity. This division helps explain the origins of music & language, & casts new light on the history of philosophy, as well as on some mental illnesses.

A poet, performance artist, art critic, and professor of visual arts, Antin, since his college days in New York in the '50s, has been at the cutting edge of the avant-garde. The avant-garde? Yes, if by this is meant not an image of fashion but the place where art and life intersect, imparting to both a greater urgency - if is meant the place where experience and knowledge find their deepest expression, where the idea of a universal language can find shape, where the price of art is itself, where the fringe is the very center of existence.", "author": "David Antin"}, {"title": "The Zephyrs of Najd: The Poetics of Nostalgia in The Classical Arabic Nasib", "isbn": "0226773361", "averageRating": "4.50", "description": "Arabs have traditionally considered classical Arabic poetry, together with the Qur'an, as one of their supreme cultural accomplishments. Taking a comparatist approach, Jaroslav Stetkevych attempts in this book to integrate the classical Arabic lyric into an enlarged understanding of lyric poetry as a genre.\nStetkevych concentrates on the \"places of lost bliss\" that furnish the dominant motif in the lyric-elegiac opening section (nasib) of the classic Arab code, or qusidah. In defining the Arabic lyrical genre, he shows how pre-Islamic lamentations over abandoned campsites evolved, in Arabo-Islamic mystical poetry, into expressions of spiritual nostalgia. Stetkevych also draws intriguing parallels between the highlands of Najd in Arabic poetry and Arcadia in the European tradition. He concludes by exploring the degree to which the pastoral-paradisiacal archetype of the nasibpervades Arabic literary perception, from the pre-Islamic ode through the Thousand and One Nightsand later texts.\nEnhanced by Stetkevych's sensitive translations of all the Arabic texts discussed, The Zephyrs of Najdbrings the classical Arabic ode fully into the purview of contemporary literary and critical discourse.", "author": "Jaroslav Stetkevych"}, {"title": "Mr. Either/Or", "isbn": "0997745525", "averageRating": "4.53", "description": "Aaron Poochigian's Mr. Either/Oris an ingenious debut, a verse novel melding American mythology, noir thriller, and classical epic into gritty rhythms, foreboding overtones, and groovy jams surrounding the reader in a surreal atmosphere.
