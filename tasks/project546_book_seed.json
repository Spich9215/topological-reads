The difference between right & left hemispheres has been puzzled over for centuries. In a book of unprecedented scope, McGilchrist draws on a vast body of recent brain research, illustrated with case histories, to reveal that the difference is profound--not just this or that function, but two whole, coherent, but incompatible ways of experiencing the world. The left hemisphere is detail oriented, prefers mechanisms to living things & is inclined to self-interest. The right hemisphere has greater breadth, flexibility & generosity. This division helps explain the origins of music & language, & casts new light on the history of philosophy, as well as on some mental illnesses. The 2nd part of the book takes a journey thru the history of Western culture, illustrating the tension between these two worlds as revealed in the thought & belief of thinkers & artists, from Aeschylus to Magritte. He argues that, despite its inferior grasp of reality, the left hemisphere is increasingly taking precedence in the modern world, with potentially disastrous consequences.\nList of Illustrations\nAcknowledgments\nIntroduction\nAsymmetry and the brain --\nWhat do the two hemispheres 'do'? --\nLanguage, truth and music --\nThe nature of the two worlds --\nThe primacy of the right hemisphere --\nThe triumph of the left hemisphere --\nImitation and the evolution of culture --\nThe ancient world --\nThe Renaissance and the Reformation --\nThe Enlightenment --\nRomanticism and the Industrial Revolution --\nThe modern and post-modern worlds\nConclusion\nNotes\nBibliography\nIndex", "author": "Iain McGilchrist"}, {"title": "The Mermaid\u2019s Madness", "isbn": "", "averageRating": "3.90", "description": "What would happen if a star writer went back to the darker themes of the original fairy tales for plots, and then crossed the Disney princesses with Charlie's Angels?
